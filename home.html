  <p>&emsp;The Linear Algebra calculator on this webpage is a way of
    looking at the subject algorithmically. As students of computer science, this
    is the view we take of nearly everything. As for the computer, it is the
    only view. </p>
  <br>
  <p>&emsp;The interest in the algorigthms is twofold; one is a matter of teaching,
    the other is a matter of learning. In mathematics it is good to have an intuition
    as to what you are doing, and Dr. Davis has done yeoman's work trying to give all
    of us this intuition. The computer has no such luxury (of Dr. Davis or intuition.)
    It can only take a set of numbers and a sequence of instructions and execute the
    given instructions on the given numbers. As a matter of teaching, this makes
    the teacher's job a little more difficult because computers do not
    know what you mean. They do <i>exactly</i> what you tell them to do.
    And to tell this stupid box what you want it to do, you have to tell it in a
    language it understands, which is of course not English. In an essay titled
    <u>In the Beginning... Was the Command Line</u>, Neal Stephenson said, "Back
    in the days of the command-line interface, users ... had to convert their
    thoughts into alphanumeric symbols and type them in, a grindingly tedious
    process that stripped away all ambiguity, laid bare all hidden assumptions,
    and cruelly punished laziness and imprecision."</p>
    <p>&emsp;This gets us to the matter of learning. It is rare to teach something
    without learning in the process. This is just as true whether teaching computers
    or people. The process Stephenson wrote about, removing ambiguity and implicit
    assumptions, does a great deal in the way of clarifying thought and truly
    understanding the process you are attempting to explain. This is, incidently,
    the genesis of this project. The process of multiplying two matrices was
    confusing to me until I sat in front of my code editor and wrote the Python
    code seen on the matrix multiplication page. After that, it is nearly impossible
    to be confused about the process.</p>
    <p>&emsp;The other lesson learned in looking at the algorithms in linear algebra
    came from a bit of human intuition. As conceived, this project was going to
    implement algorithms as learned in class... until we got to the determinant portion.
    // $$O(n!)$$ something something... Laplace Expansion = O(n!), LUD = O(n^3)//
